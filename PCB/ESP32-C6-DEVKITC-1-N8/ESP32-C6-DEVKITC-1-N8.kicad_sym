Built around the ESP32-C6-WROOM-1 module, it supports multiple connectivity options including 802.11 b/g/n/ax Wi-Fi, Bluetooth® (BLE), and 802.15.4 for Thread and Zigbee® protocols. The board is powered by the ESP32-C6 chip with 8MB SPI flash, offering advanced processing power and efficient memory management. It features GPIO ports for extensive interfacing, along with a USB Type-C™ to UART port for power and communication. The board also includes a USB-to-UART bridge, pin header, and boot/reset buttons, operating at 3.3V with a 5V to 3.3V power regulator. This development board is ideal for exploring a wide range of wireless applications, including IoT, smart home devices, and RF communication projects.\n                        \n" (id 5) (at 0 0 0)
